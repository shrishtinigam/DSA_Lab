External Node / Leaf Node / Terminal Node
Edge 
Sibling
Height of a node - no. of edges from deepest Leaf
Height of a tree - height of root 
Depth of a node - no. of edges from root
Depth of a tree - depth of a leaf
Degree of a node - no. of a children at the node
Level
Path - sequence of nodes
Degree of a tree - max degree of a node

Types of Trees 

General Tree 
Binary Tree 
Binary Search Tree 
Full Binary Tree / Proper Binary Tree - every node node has either two or no children
Complete Binary Tree - completely filled from left to right except possibly the last one 
Perfect Binary Tree - every internal node has 2 child nodes & all leaf nodes are at same level
